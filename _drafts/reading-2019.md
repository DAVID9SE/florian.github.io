### [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293354)

![book cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/foundation.jpg)

a
- One of the most popular pieces of Asimov
- Read Asimov's short stories and liked them a lot, so I decided to read one of his novels

b
- Fundamental idea: All empires in our world are finite. At some point they collapse in themselves and a time of chaos ensues
- During this time, knowledge is lost and science stops progressing. E.g. Roman Empire and Middle Ages
- Foundation takes place in the far future, where one huge empire rules the entire galaxy

c
- Hari Seldon, a scientist, is at the forefront of a new science that can be used to predict large events in the future. Individual people are too probabilistic, but in large masses the overall events become more predictable
- He predicts that the empire is going to collapse in a few hundred years and that it will take thousands of years without any scientific progress until a new empire is formed

d
- He proposes starting two new colonies, the foundations, where scientists try to preserve the knowledge until the next empire forms
- Rest of the story tells the fate about the first foundation and how it tries to survive in the chaos that ensues in the next two hundred years
- I really liked the general concept and the way the story was told

### [Foundation and Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Empire-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293370)

![book cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/foundation-and-empire.png)

- In the second Foundation book, the first foundation has to establish itself against the empire
- The first part of the book is rather similar to the first book
- The second half discusses events that were too probabilistic to be predicted, since they were caused by individuals
- At this point the book becomes more exciting since it is the first time that the reader cannot be sure that Harry Seldon planned for events

### [Second Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Foundation-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293362)

![book cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/second-foundation.png)

- In the third book, and final book of the original book, the focus shifts to the second foundation
- Events pick up a few years where they left off in the first book, but the same line of events is discussed
- Generally really liked the series a lot
- Characters in the books are usually not very complex, but that's due to the fact that the story plays over a very long amount of time and is more concerned with the overall direction that humanity is going in
- Books are rather old and it's cool to see how Asimov predicted some devices that we ended up having, e.g. machines for purchasing public transport tickets (though they still use cash) or typewriters that automatically fix typos
- There's two prequels and sequels to Foundation, so might read them in the future

### [Do No Harm](https://www.amazon.com/Do-No-Harm-Stories-Surgery/dp/125009013X)

![book cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/do-no-harm.jpg)

- Recommended by [Swathi](https://github.com/swathiiyer2)
- Stories from a neurosurgeon
- Each chapter tells a story from his life
- Very honest. One of the stories is about him worrying whether he messed up an operation because he was in an angry mood before
- Interesting insight: Training neurosurgeons is incredibly difficult. They have to operate on real patients to learn, but they'll make more mistakes than experienced surgeons. However, if you don't give them the chance to learn in the real world, they will never get better
- Incredibly different to how someone learns math or CS for example

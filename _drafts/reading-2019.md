### [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293354)

![Foundation cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/foundation.jpg)

I started reading some of [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)'s short stories a few years ago and liked them a lot â€“ especially [The Last Question](https://www.multivax.com/last_question.html) and [Franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_(short_story)).
This year, I decided I should give his novels a read as well.
In the end I chose the Foundation series, one of Asimov's most popular pieces of work.

One of the central ideas of the series is that empires in our world last a very finite amount of time.
At some point, they collapse and a time of chaos ensues.
During that time, science stops progressing and a lot of knowledge is lost.
This was, for example, the case with the Roman Empire and the subsequent Middle Ages.

*Foundation* takes place in a far future, where one huge empire rules the entire galaxy.
Hari Seldon is a researcher at the forefront of a new science that can be used to predict large events in the future.
While individual people act too probabilistically, large masses of people are more predictable.
Since the galaxy is now inhabited by a huge number of people, Seldon can estimate with high probability how the empire is going to develop.
He predicts that the empire is going to collapse in a few hundred years, and that thousands of years of civil wars without scientific progress are about to follow.

To ensure that scientific progress is slowed down as little as possible, he proposes the settlement of two new colonies, the *foundations*.
These civilizations should exist for the sole purpose of preserving the world's knowledge until the next empire forms.
The rest of the book tells the fate of the first foundation and how it tries to survive in the chaos of the next two hundred years.
I really liked the fundamental idea behind the book and how the story was told.

### [Foundation and Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Empire-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293370)

The second Foundation book is split into two parts.
In the initial half, the first foundation is trying to establish itself against the old, falling empire.
This part is rather similar to the first book.

The second half discusses events that were too unlikely to have been predicted, since they were caused by individuals.
At this point the book becomes more exciting.
It is the first time in the books that the reader cannot be certain about whether Hari Seldon planned for  events.

While I generally enjoyed the Asimov's writing style, I did notice that most of the characters were rather one-dimensional.
However, because of the way the books are laid out, this is not a major issue.
Since the story is concerned with the overall direction that humanity is moving in, there just seemed to be little room for complex individuals.

### [Second Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Foundation-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293362)

![Second Foundation cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/second-foundation.png)

In the third book, and final book of the original trilogy, the focus shifts to the second foundation.
Events pick up a few years from where the second book left off, but the same line of events is discussed.
It is hard to talk about the third book in a series without spoiling the first two parts, so I am omitting a more thorough summary at this point.

All in all I really liked the Foundation trilogy.
A lot of the ideas presented are really interesting and I enjoyed the way the stories were told.
There are two prequels and two sequels to the original trilogy, so in the future I might read those.

I also noticed that Asimov made some fairly good predictions about the future.
Even though the books are fairly old, he does predict a number of devices that exist today, for example a typewriter that automatically corrects typos.
Interestingly, physical cash still seems to be a thing in the story, e.g. for machines that let you buy public transport tickets.

### [Do No Harm](https://www.amazon.com/Do-No-Harm-Stories-Surgery/dp/125009013X)

![Do No Harm cover](/assets/posts/books-2019/do-no-harm.jpg)

*Do No Harm*, recommended to me by [Swathi](https://github.com/swathiiyer2), is the autobiographical book of a British neurosurgeon.
Each chapter tells a story from his life, with most of them discussing specific medical cases.
Other parts of the book talk about events that happened in the author's life.

I liked that the book seemed to be written in a very honest way.
For example, one of the chapters starts with a story about how an unnecessary fight caused him to be in an angry mood before a surgery.
Later, he worries whether the operation did not go as well as it could have gone simply because he was in the wrong mood to maintain perfect focus.

Another interesting insight was how difficult it is to train new neurosurgeons.
They have to operate on real patients to learn, but until they have enough practice, they will make more mistakes than experienced surgeons.
However, if you do not give new surgeons the chance to learn in the real world, they can never get any better.
It generally struck me as interesting that in this line of work there is a much higher cost attached to things like having an off day or to training the next generation.

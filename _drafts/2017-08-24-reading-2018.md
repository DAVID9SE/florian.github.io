### [Papers](https://github.com/florian/reading-notes/tree/master/papers)

I noticed that I ended up reading a lot more papers this year than I did in the previous years.
This mostly started in March when I began looking into the literature for my master's thesis.
I noticed that I read more papers in the first three weeks than I did in the entirety of working on my undergrad thesis.

When I handed-in my thesis in August, I tried to keep the momentum going and took a more structured approach to reading papers.
From late August on, I averaged nearly exactly one paper per week.
For most of them, I ended up publishing [reading notes](https://github.com/florian/reading-notes/tree/master/papers) on GitHub.
Writing notes as I was working through the paper turned out to be a great learning mechanism.
I still slightly regret not doing this in an organized manner earlier.

Reading papers also turned out to be beneficial to my work at Google.
Since Google publishes papers about a lot of internal systems, reading those papers allowed me to understand the concepts more deeply than I would have by just directly using some interface to them.
Besides classic papers on MapReduce or Dremel, there were also other interesting papers, for example on Google's monorepo or on the cluster computing system Borg.
All in all, I ended up reading 10 papers on Google systems.

My focus this year was mostly on reading well-known papers where it was clear that I would gain valuable knowledge.
I have not decided yet if I want to switch more towards reading fresh research papers.
My favorite papers I read this year were [...], [...] and [...].

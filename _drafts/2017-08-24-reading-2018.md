[Intro]

### [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032/)

![The Three-Body Problem cover](/assets/posts/books-2018/three-body.jpg)

- Recommended by [Yu](https://dorianhe.github.io)
- Science fiction novel
- Famous scientists keep committing suicid, saying that science does not make sense anymore
- A second story line plays in the past at an army base meant for experiments
- Over time, the story lines become more connected. A lot of people are motivated by historical things they witnessed
- Good book, but mostly sets up the stage for the next two books

### [The Dark Forest](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Forest-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765386690/)

![The Dark Forest cover](/assets/posts/books-2018/dark-forest.jpg)

- Sequel to the Three-Body Problem
- Book covers a long time period, which makes it really interesting to see how things change
- Probably my favorite book of the triology
- A lot of interesting psychological thought experiments
- The general theory that the book is named after is super interesting. I still think about it from time to time
- Sadly very few of the characters from the first book reappear

### [Death's End](https://www.amazon.com/Deaths-End-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765386631/)

![Death's End cover](/assets/posts/books-2018/deaths-end.jpg)

- Last part of the triology
- Similar concept to the second book, a lot of time passes
- Every few chapters a short excerpt from a history book that comments on the current events is given. This is an interesting format and was really interesting to read
- The very end is a bit weak. Ending the book 50 or so pages earlier would've been better

### [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/)

![Cracking the Coding Interview cover](/assets/posts/books-2018/ctci.jpg)

- Read most parts in 2016 already and worked through most of it back then
- Decided to re-read everything on the weekend before my Google onsite, just for refreshing some concepts
- Good time investment
- Much less satisfied with the book than two years ago. Some of the analysis is way too simplified, and at least a few border on being wrong (see Reddit post)
- Good for getting an overview in one place and for getting some idea on what to expect in algorithm interviews. When having more than one weekend, taking a very thorough algorithm class for the theory while solving problems on leetcode was much more effective for me

### [The Master Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465094279/)

![The Master Algorithm cover](/assets/posts/books-2018/master-algorithm.jpg)

- Popular scientific book about machine learning
- Very high-level, gives a nice overview of fundamental concepts and also some of the history behind ML
- The author uses a ton of analogies, some were great, some not so good. But it is evident that he put in a lot of effort to try to explain ML to people without much prior knowledge
- Fundamental idea behind the book: There are five schools of though in ML (connectionist (which is currently dominating), evolutionist, bayesian, analogist, symbolist). To create a master algorithm that matches the learning power of our brains, ideas from all these tribes should be combined
- The first part of the book introduces the five tribes and their main ideas. This was the strongest part of the book and I will probably go through this again at some point
- The second part attempts to describe how to combine them. This feels a bit forced. It's also fairly abstract since it's not entirely clear how this should work

### [Kane and Abel](https://www.amazon.com/Kane-Abel-Jeffrey-Archer/dp/0312942729/)

![Kane And Abel cover](/assets/posts/books-2018/kane-and-abel.jpg)

- Suggested by [Prathiksha](https://twitter.com/prathiksha0105)
- The story of two men that were born on the same day but in totally different parts of the world
- Both are similar in that they are nearly entirely driven by ambition
- Book describes their way to power
- Great writing style, very eloquent
- Not many surprises in the book. Most plots are either fairly predictable or are resolved in the very same chapter
- That's totally fine though. It's a very entertaining read. Most of the satisfication for me from reading this came from seeing the two main characters progress, not from the suspense of not knowing what's happening
- Decided to read the two sequels to this book

### [Papers](https://github.com/florian/reading-notes/tree/master/papers)

I noticed that I ended up reading a lot more papers this year than I did in the previous years.
This mostly started in March when I began looking into the literature for my master's thesis.
I noticed that I read more papers in the first three weeks than I did in the entirety of working on my undergrad thesis.

When I handed-in my thesis in August, I tried to keep the momentum going and took a more structured approach to reading papers.
From late August on, I averaged nearly exactly one paper per week.
For most of them, I ended up publishing [reading notes](https://github.com/florian/reading-notes/tree/master/papers) on GitHub.
Writing notes as I was working through a paper turned out to be a great learning mechanism.
I still slightly regret not doing this in an organized manner earlier.

Reading papers also turned out to be beneficial to my work at Google.
Since Google publishes papers about a lot of internal systems, reading those papers allowed me to understand the concepts more deeply than I would have by just interacting with the systems through some interface.
Besides classic papers on MapReduce or Dremel, there were also other interesting papers, for example on [Google's monorepo](https://github.com/florian/reading-notes/blob/master/papers/3_Why_Google_Stores_Billions_of_Lines_of_Code_in_a_Single_Repository.md) or on the cluster computing system Borg.
All in all, I ended up reading 10 papers on Google systems.

My favorite papers I read this year were [...], [...] and [...].
It is worth noting that my focus was mostly on reading well-known papers where it was clear that I would gain valuable knowledge.
I have not decided yet if I should start reading really new papers more heavily.

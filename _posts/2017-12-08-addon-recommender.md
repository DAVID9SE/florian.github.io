This is a reading suggestion for a very interesting post from the Mozilla Context Graph blog. The
blog post describes the new prototype of the Firefox add-on recommender
system: [https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/add-on-recommendations-for-firefox-users-7774cc5a5117](https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/add-on-recommendations-for-firefox-users-7774cc5a5117)

It was also cross-posted to [Alessio's blog](https://www.a2p.it/wordpress/tech-stuff/mozilla/add-on-recommendations-for-firefox-users-a-prototype-recommender-system-leveraging-existing-data-sources/).

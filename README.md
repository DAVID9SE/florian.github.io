- Static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- The theme is based on [estivo](https://github.com/fffabs/estivo) ([demo](https://jekyll-demos.github.io/estivo/))


## Installation

```sh
gem install jekyll jekyll-paginate
```

## Conventions

- All references are in Harvard citation style
- Book covers in the "What I read" posts are scaled to a width of 300px

## Spell Checking

After [aspell](http://aspell.net) was installed, all `_posts` and `_drafts` can be spell-checked automatically:

```sh
make spellcheck
make s # as a shortcut
```

## Custom Includes

### Images

To add an image from the image asset folder of the current post, with a given caption:

```
{% include img.html url="x.png" description="caption" %}
```

Optionally, there's a `style` attribute for the caption and a `width` attribute for the image itself:

```
{% include img.html url="x.png" description="caption" style="margin-top:0" width="200px" %}
```
